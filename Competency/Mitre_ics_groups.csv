G1000;ALLANITE;[ALLANITE](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Group/G0009) is a suspected Russian cyber espionage group, that has primarily targeted the electric utility sector within the United States and United Kingdom. The group's tactics and techniques are reportedly similar to [Dragonfly](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Group/G0002) / [Dragonfly 2.0](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Group/G0006), although ALLANITEÕs technical capabilities have not exhibited disruptive or destructive abilities. It has been suggested that the group maintains a presence in ICS for the purpose of gaining understanding of processes and to maintain persistence.

A similar group emerged in 2015 and was identified by Symantec as [Dragonfly 2.0](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0074). There is debate over the extent of the overlap between [Dragonfly](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0035) and [Dragonfly 2.0](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0074), but there is sufficient evidence to lead to these being tracked as two separate groups.

G1001;HEXANE;[HEXANE](https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Group/G0005) is a threat group that has targeted ICS organization within the oil & gas, and telecommunications sectors. Many of the targeted organizations have been located in the Middle East including Kuwait. HEXANE's targeting of telecommunications has been speculated to be part of an effort to establish man-in-the-middle capabilities throughout the region.
