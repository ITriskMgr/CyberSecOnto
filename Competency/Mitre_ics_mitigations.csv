M0801;Access Management;Access Management technologies can be used to enforce authorization polices and decisions, especially when existing field devices do not provided capabilities to support user identification and authentication. (Citation: NIST SP 1800-2) These technologies typically utilize an in-line network device or gateway system to prevent access to unauthenticated users, while also integrating with an authentication service to first verify user credentials.

M0949;Antivirus/Antimalware;Use signatures or heuristics to detect malicious software. Within industrial control environments, antivirus/antimalware installations should be limited to assets that are not involved in critical or real-time operations. To minimize the impact to system availability, all products should first be validated within a representative test environment before deployment to production systems.(Citation: CISA Antivirus ICS August 2018);https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Mitigation/M0949;11 June 2019;31 March 2020;1.0
M0913;Application Developer Guidance;This mitigation describes any guidance or training given to developers of applications to avoid introducing security weaknesses that an adversary may be able to take advantage of.;https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Mitigation/M0913;25 October 2017;10 April 2021;1.0
M0948;Application Isolation and Sandboxing;Restrict execution of code to a virtual environment on or in transit to an endpoint system.;https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Mitigation/M0948;11 June 2019;10 April 2021;1.0
M0947;Audit;Perform audits or scans of systems, permissions, insecure software, insecure configurations, etc. to identify potential weaknesses. Perform periodic integrity checks of the device to validate the correctness of the firmware, software, programs, and configurations. Integrity checks, which typically include cryptographic hashes or digital signatures, should be compared to those obtained at known valid states, especially after events like device reboots, program downloads, or program restarts.;https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Mitigation/M0947;11 June 2019;10 April 2021;1.0
M0800;Authorization Enforcement;The device or system should restrict access to read, manipulate, or execute system objects to only authenticated users who require access based on approved security policies. Role-based Access Control (RBAC) schemes can help reduce the overhead of assigning permissions to the large number of devices within an ICS. For example, IEC 62351 provides examples of roles used to support common system operations within the electric power sector (Citation: IEC 62351), while IEEE 1686 provide sets of standard permissions for users of IEDs.

M0953;Data Backup;Take and store data backups from end user systems and critical servers. Ensure backup and storage systems are hardened and kept separate from the corporate network to prevent compromise. Maintain and exercise incident response plans, including the management of 'gold-copy' back-up images and configurations for key systems to enable quick recovery and response from adversarial activities that impact control, view, or availability.;https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Mitigation/M0953;19 July 2019;10 April 2021;1.0
M0803;Data Loss Prevention;Data Loss Prevention (DLP) technologies can be used to help identify adversarial attempts to exfiltrate operational information, such as engineering plans, trade secrets, recipes, intellectual property, or process telemetry. DLP functionality may be built into other security products such as firewalls or stand alone suites running on the network and host-based agents. DLP may be configured to prevent the transfer of information through corporate resources such as email, web, and physical media such as USB for host-based solutions.;https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Mitigation/M0803;11 September 2020;17 September 2020;1.0

M0937;Filter Network Traffic;Use network appliances to filter ingress or egress traffic and perform protocol-based filtering. Configure software on endpoints to filter network traffic. Perform inline allow/denylisting of network messages based on the application layer (OSI Layer 7) protocol, especially for automation protocols. Application allowlists are beneficial when there are well-defined communication sequences, types, rates, or patterns needed during expected system operations. Application denylists may be needed if all acceptable communication sequences cannot be defined, but instead a set of known malicious uses can be denied (e.g., excessive communication attempts, shutdown messages, invalid commands). Devices performing these functions are often referred to as deep-packet inspection (DPI) firewalls, context-aware firewalls, or firewalls blocking specific automation/SCADA protocol aware firewalls.;https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Mitigation/M0937;11 June 2019;10 April 2021;1.1
M0804;Human User Authentication;The device should require that a user authenticates before they can remotely access it, or send a command to it. While strong multi-factor authentication is preferrable, it is not always feasible within this ICS environments. Performing strong user authentication also requires additional security controls and processes which are often the target of related adversarial techniques (e.g., Valid Accounts, Default Credentials). Therefore, associated ATT&CK mitigations should be considered in addition to this, including Multi-factor Authentication  (M1032), Account Use Policies (M1036), Password Policies (M1027), User Account Management (M1018), Privileged Account Management  (M1026), and User Account Control (M1052).;https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Mitigation/M0804;11 September 2020;17 September 2020;1.0

M0805;Mechanical Protection Layers;Utilize a layered protection design based on physical or mechanical protection systems to prevent damage to property, equipment, human safety, or the environment. Preferably protection devices should have minimal digital components to prevent exposure to related adversarial techniques. Examples of include interlocks, rupture disk, release values, etc. (Citation: IEC 61511);https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Mitigation/M0805;11 September 2020;17 September 2020;1.0
M0806;Minimize Wireless Signal Propagation;Wireless signals frequently propagate outside of organizational boundaries, which provide opportunities for adversaries to monitor or gain unauthorized access to the wireless communication. (Citation: CISA Mar 2010) To minimize this threat, organizations should implement measures to detect, understand, and reduce unnecessary RF propagation. (Citation: DHS National Urban Security Technology Laboratory Apr 2019) Techniques can include (i) reducing transmission power on wireless signals, (ii) adjust antenna gain to prevent extensions beyond organizational boundaries, and (iii) employ RF shielding techniques to block excessive signal propagation.;https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Mitigation/M0806;11 September 2020;17 September 2020;1.0
M0816;Mitigation Limited or Not Effective;This type of attack technique cannot be easily mitigated with preventative controls since it is based on the abuse of system features.;https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Mitigation/M0816;11 September 2020;17 September 2020;1.0
M0932;Multi-factor Authentication;"Use two or more pieces of evidence to authenticate to a system; such as username and password in addition to a token from a physical smart card or token generator. Within industrial control environments assets such as low-level controllers, workstations, and HMIs have real-time operational control and safety requirements which may restrict the use of multi-factor.";https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Mitigation/M0932;10 June 2019;10 April 2021;1.0
M0807;Network Allowlists;Network allowlists can be implemented through either host-based files or system hosts files to specify what external connections (e.g., IP address, MAC address, port, protocol) can be made from a device. Allowlist techniques that operate at the application layer (e.g., DNP3, Modbus, HTTP) are addressed in Filter Network Traffic mitigation.;https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Mitigation/M0807;10 June 2019;12 April 2021;1.0
M0931;Network Intrusion Prevention;Use intrusion detection signatures to block traffic at network boundaries. In industrial control environments, network intrusion prevention should be configured so it will not disrupt protocols and communications responsible for real-time functions related to control or safety.;https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Mitigation/M0931;10 June 2019;10 April 2021;1.0
M0930;Network Segmentation;Architect sections of the network to isolate critical systems, functions, or resources. Use physical and logical segmentation to prevent access to potentially sensitive systems and information. Use a DMZ to contain any internet-facing services that should not be exposed from the internal network. Restrict network access to only required systems and services. In addition, prevent systems from other networks or business functions (e.g., enterprise) from accessing critical process control systems. For example, in IEC 62443, systems within the same secure level should be grouped into a 'zone', and access to that zone is restricted by a 'conduit', or mechanism to restrict data flows between zones by segmenting the network.;https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Mitigation/M0928;10 June 2019;10 April 2021;1.0

M0809;Operational Information Confidentiality;Deploy mechanisms to protect the confidentiality of information related to operational processes, facility locations, device configurations, programs, or databases that may have information that can be used to infer organizational trade-secrets, recipes, and other intellectual property (IP). Example mitigations could include restricting read privileges, encrypting data, and obfuscating the information (e.g., facility coverterms, codenames). In many cases this information may be necessary to support critical engineering, maintenance, or operational functions, therefore, it may not be feasible to implement.;https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Mitigation/M0809;06 June 2019;22 September 2020;1.0
M0810;Out-of-Band Communications Channel;Provide operators with redundant, out-of-band communication to support monitoring and control of the operational processes, especially when recovering from a network outage. (Citation: NIST Apr 2013)(Citation: DARPA) Out-of-band communication should utilize diverse systems and technologies to minimize common failure modes and vulnerabilities within the communications infrastructure. For example, wireless networks (e.g., 3G, 4G) can be used to provide diverse and redundant delivery of data.;https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Mitigation/M0810;06 June 2019;22 September 2020;1.0
