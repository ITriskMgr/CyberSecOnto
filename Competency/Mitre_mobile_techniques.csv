T1435;Access Calendar Entries;An adversary could call standard operating system APIs from a malicious application to gather calendar entry data, or with escalated privileges could directly access files containing calendar data.;https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1435;25 October 2017;17 October 2018;1.0;Collection;On both Android (6.0 and up) and iOS, the user can view which applications have permission to access calendar information through the device settings screen, and the user can choose to revoke the permissions.;Android, iOS;APP-13;
T1433;Access Call Log;"On Android, an adversary could call standard operating system APIs from a malicious application to gather call log data, or with escalated privileges could directly access files containing call log data.

On iOS, applications do not have access to the call log, so privilege escalation would be required in order to access the data.";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1433;25 October 2017;18 September 2019;1.1;Collection;On Android 6.0 and up, the user can view which applications have permission to access call log information through the device settings screen, and the user can choose to revoke the permissions.;Android, iOS;APP-13;
T1432;Access Contact List;An adversary could call standard operating system APIs from a malicious application to gather contact list (i.e., address book) data, or with escalated privileges could directly access files containing contact list data.;https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1432;25 October 2017;17 October 2018;1.0;Collection;On both Android (6.0 and up) and iOS, the user can view which applications have permission to access contact list information through the device settings screen, and the user can choose to revoke the permissions.;Android, iOS;APP-13;
T1517;Access Notifications;A malicious application can read notifications sent by the operating system or other applications, which may contain sensitive data such as one-time authentication codes sent over SMS, email, or other mediums. A malicious application can also dismiss notifications to prevent the user from noticing that the notifications arrived and can trigger action buttons contained within notifications.(Citation: ESET 2FA Bypass);https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1517;15 September 2019;09 July 2020;1.0;Collection, Credential Access;The user can inspect (and modify) the list of applications that have notification access through the device settings (e.g. Apps & notification -> Special app access -> Notification access).;Android;;Luk‡_ _tefanko, ESET
T1413;Access Sensitive Data in Device Logs;On versions of Android prior to 4.1, an adversary may use a malicious application that holds the READ_LOGS permission to obtain private keys, passwords, other credentials, or other sensitive data stored in the device's system log. On Android 4.1 and later, an adversary would need to attempt to perform an operating system privilege escalation attack to be able to access the log.;https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1413;25 October 2017;17 October 2018;1.0;Collection, Credential Access;;Android;APP-3;
T1409;Access Stored Application Data;"Adversaries may access and collect application data resident on the device. Adversaries often target popular applications such as Facebook, WeChat, and Gmail.(Citation: SWB Exodus March 2019)

This technique requires either escalated privileges or for the targeted app to have stored the data in an insecure manner (e.g., with insecure file permissions or in an insecure location such as an external storage directory).";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1409;25 October 2017;10 October 2019;2.0;Collection, Credential Access;Accessing stored application data can be difficult to detect, and therefore enterprises may be better served focusing on detection at other stages of adversarial behavior.;Android, iOS;AUT-0;
T1438;Alternate Network Mediums;Adversaries can communicate using cellular networks rather than enterprise Wi-Fi in order to bypass enterprise network monitoring systems. Adversaries may also communicate using other non-Internet Protocol mediums such as SMS, NFC, or Bluetooth to bypass network monitoring systems.;https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1438;25 October 2017;17 October 2018;1.0;Command And Control, Exfiltration;;Android, iOS;APP-30;
T1418;Application Discovery;"Adversaries may seek to identify all applications installed on the device. One use case for doing so is to identify the presence of endpoint security applications that may increase the adversary's risk of detection. Another use case is to identify the presence of applications that the adversary may wish to target.

On Android, applications can use methods in the PackageManager class (Citation: Android-PackageManager) to enumerate other apps installed on device, or an entity with shell access can use the pm command line tool.

On iOS, apps can use private API calls to obtain a list of other apps installed on the device. (Citation: Kurtz-MaliciousiOSApps) However, use of private API calls will likely prevent the application from being distributed through Apple's App Store.";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1418;25 October 2017;17 October 2018;1.0;Defense Evasion, Discovery;;Android, iOS;;
T1427;Attack PC via USB Connection;With escalated privileges, an adversary could program the mobile device to impersonate USB devices such as input devices (keyboard and mouse), storage devices, and/or networking devices in order to attack a physically connected PC(Citation: Wang-ExploitingUSB)(Citation: ArsTechnica-PoisonTap) This technique has been demonstrated on Android. We are unaware of any demonstrations on iOS.;https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1427;25 October 2017;03 February 2019;1.1;Lateral Movement;;Android;PHY-2;
T1402;Broadcast Receivers;"An intent is a message passed between Android application or system components. Applications can register to receive broadcast intents at runtime, which are system-wide intents delivered to each app when certain events happen on the device, such as network changes or the user unlocking the screen. Malicious applications can then trigger certain actions within the app based on which broadcast intent was received.

Further, malicious applications can register for intents broadcasted by other applications in addition to the Android system itself. This allows the malware to respond based on actions in other applications. This behavior typically indicates a more intimate knowledge, or potentially the targeting of specific devices, users, or applications.

In Android 8 (API level 26), broadcast intent behavior was changed, limiting the implicit intents that applications can register for in the manifest. In most cases, applications that register through the manifest will no longer receive the broadcasts. Now, applications must register context-specific broadcast receivers while the user is actively using the app.(Citation: Android Changes to System Broadcasts)";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1402;25 October 2017;27 March 2020;2.0;Execution, Persistence;Broadcast intent receivers are part of standard OS-level APIs and are therefore typically undetectable to the end user.;Android;;Alex Hinchliffe, Palo Alto Networks
T1429;Capture Audio;"Adversaries may capture audio to collect information on a user of a mobile device using standard operating system APIs. Adversaries may target audio information such as user conversations, surroundings, phone calls, or other sensitive information.

Android and iOS, by default, requires that an application request access to microphone devices from the user. In Android, applications must hold the <code>android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO</code> permission to access the microphone and the <code>android.permission.CAPTURE_AUDIO_OUTPUT</code> permission to access audio output such as speakers. Android does not allow third-party applications to hold <code>android.permission.CAPTURE_AUDIO_OUTPUT</code>, so audio output can only be obtained by privileged applications (distributed by Google or the device vendor) or after a successful privilege escalation attack. In iOS, applications must include the `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` key in their `Info.plist` file.";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1429;25 October 2017;20 September 2019;2.0;Collection;On both Android (6.0 and up) and iOS, the user can view which applications have permission to use the microphone through the device settings screen, and the user can choose to revoke the permissions.;Android, iOS;APP-19;
T1512;Capture Camera;Adversaries may utilize the camera to capture information about the user, their surroundings, or other physical identifiers. Adversaries may use the physical camera devices on a mobile device to capture images or video. By default, in Android and iOS, an application must request permission to access a camera device which is granted by the user through a request prompt. In Android, applications must hold the `android.permission.CAMERA` permission to access the camera. In iOS, applications must include the `NSCameraUsageDescription` key in the `Info.plist` file, and must request access to the camera at runtime.;https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1512;09 August 2019;12 September 2019;1.0;Collection;On Android and iOS, the user can view which applications have permission to use the camera through the device settings screen, and the user can choose to revoke the permissions.;Android, iOS;APP-19;
T1414;Capture Clipboard Data;"Adversaries may abuse Clipboard Manager APIs to obtain sensitive information copied to the global clipboard. For example, passwords being copy-and-pasted from a password manager app could be captured by another application installed on the device.(Citation: Fahl-Clipboard)

On Android, <code>ClipboardManager.OnPrimaryClipChangedListener</code> can be used by applications to register as a listener and monitor the clipboard for changes.(Citation: Github Capture Clipboard 2019)

Android 10 mitigates this technique by preventing applications from accessing clipboard data unless the application is on the foreground or is set as the deviceÕs default input method editor (IME).(Citation: Android 10 Privacy Changes)";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1414;25 October 2017;13 September 2019;2.0;Collection, Credential Access;Capturing clipboard content can be difficult to detect, and therefore enterprises may be better served focusing on detection at other stages of adversarial behavior.;Android, iOS;APP-35;
T1412;Capture SMS Messages;"A malicious application could capture sensitive data sent via SMS, including authentication credentials. SMS is frequently used to transmit codes used for multi-factor authentication.

On Android, a malicious application must request and obtain permission (either at app install time or run time) in order to receive SMS messages. Alternatively, a malicious application could attempt to perform an operating system privilege escalation attack to bypass the permission requirement.

On iOS, applications cannot access SMS messages in normal operation, so an adversary would need to attempt to perform an operating system privilege escalation attack to potentially be able to access SMS messages.";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1412;25 October 2017;18 September 2019;1.1;Collection, Credential Access;On Android, the user can view which applications have permission to access SMS messages through the device settings, and the user can choose to revoke the permission.;Android, iOS;;
T1448;Carrier Billing Fraud;"A malicious app may trigger fraudulent charges on a victimÕs carrier billing statement in several different ways, including SMS toll fraud and SMS shortcodes that make purchases.

Performing SMS fraud relies heavily upon the fact that, when making SMS purchases, the carriers perform device verification but not user verification. This allows adversaries to make purchases on behalf of the user, with little or no user interaction.(Citation: Google Bread)

Malicious applications may also perform toll billing, which occurs when carriers provide payment endpoints over a web page. The application connects to the web page over cellular data so the carrier can directly verify the number, or the application must retrieve a code sent via SMS and enter it into the web page.(Citation: Google Bread)

On iOS, apps cannot send SMS messages.

On Android, apps must hold the `SEND_SMS` permission to send SMS messages. Additionally, Android version 4.2 and above has mitigations against this threat by requiring user consent before allowing SMS messages to be sent to premium numbers (Citation: AndroidSecurity2014).";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1448;25 October 2017;04 May 2020;2.0;Impact;"Starting with Android 4.2 the user is prompted and must provide consent before applications can send SMS messages to premium numbers.(Citation: AndroidSecurity2014)

On Android 6.0 and up, the user can view which applications have permission to send SMS messages through the device settings screen, and the user can choose to revoke the permissions.";Android;;
T1510;Clipboard Modification;"Adversaries may abuse clipboard functionality to intercept and replace information in the Android device clipboard.(Citation: ESET Clipboard Modification February 2019)(Citation: Welivesecurity Clipboard Modification February 2019)(Citation: Syracuse Clipboard Modification 2014) Malicious applications may monitor the clipboard activity through the <code>ClipboardManager.OnPrimaryClipChangedListener</code> interface on Android to determine when the clipboard contents have changed.(Citation: Dr.Webb Clipboard Modification origin2 August 2018)(Citation: Dr.Webb Clipboard Modification origin August 2018) Listening to clipboard activity, reading the clipboard contents, and modifying the clipboard contents requires no explicit application permissions and can be performed by applications running in the background, however, this behavior has changed with the release of Android 10.(Citation: Android 10 Privacy Changes)

Adversaries may use [Clipboard Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1510) to replace text prior to being pasted, for example, replacing a copied Bitcoin wallet address with a wallet address that is under adversarial control.

[Clipboard Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1510) had been seen within the Android/Clipper.C trojan. This sample had been detected by ESET in an application distributed through the Google Play Store targeting cryptocurrency wallet numbers.(Citation: ESET Clipboard Modification February 2019)";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1510;26 July 2019;28 October 2019;1.0;Impact;Modifying clipboard content can be difficult to detect, and therefore enterprises may be better served focusing on detection at other stages of adversarial behavior.;Android;;
T1540;Code Injection;"Adversaries may use code injection attacks to implant arbitrary code into the address space of a running application. Code is then executed or interpreted by that application. Adversaries utilizing this technique may exploit capabilities to load code in at runtime through dynamic libraries.

With root access, `ptrace` can be used to target specific applications and load shared libraries into its process memory.(Citation: Shunix Code Injection Mar 2016)(Citation: Fadeev Code Injection Aug 2018) By injecting code, an adversary may be able to gain access to higher permissions held by the targeted application by executing as the targeted application. In addition, the adversary may be able to evade detection or enable persistent access to a system under the guise of the applicationÕs process.(Citation: Google Triada June 2019)

T1605;Command-Line Interface;"Adversaries may use built-in command-line interfaces to interact with the device and execute commands. Android provides a bash shell that can be interacted with over the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) or programmatically using JavaÕs `Runtime` package. On iOS, adversaries can interact with the underlying runtime shell if the device has been jailbroken.

If the device has been rooted or jailbroken, adversaries may locate and invoke a superuser binary to elevate their privileges and interact with the system as the root user. This dangerous level of permissions allows the adversary to run special commands and modify protected system files.";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1605;16 December 2020;17 December 2020;1.0;Execution;Command-Line Interface execution can be difficult to detect, and therefore enterprises may be better served focusing on detection at other stages of adversarial behavior.;Android, iOS;;
T1436;Commonly Used Port;"Adversaries may communicate over a commonly used port to bypass firewalls or network detection systems and to blend with normal network activity to avoid more detailed inspection. 

They may use commonly open ports such as

* TCP:80 (HTTP)
* TCP:443 (HTTPS)
* TCP:25 (SMTP)
* TCP/UDP:53 (DNS)

They may use the protocol associated with the port or a completely different protocol.";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1436;25 October 2017;19 June 2019;1.0;Command And Control, Exfiltration;;Android, iOS;;
T1577;Compromise Application Executable;"Adversaries may modify applications installed on a device to establish persistent access to a victim. These malicious modifications can be used to make legitimate applications carry out adversary tasks when these applications are in use.

There are multiple ways an adversary can inject malicious code into applications. One method is by taking advantages of device vulnerabilities, the most well-known being Janus, an Android vulnerability that allows adversaries to add extra bytes to APK (application) and DEX (executable) files without affecting the file's signature. By being able to add arbitrary bytes to valid applications, attackers can seamlessly inject code into genuine executables without the user's knowledge.(Citation: Guardsquare Janus)

Adversaries may also rebuild applications to include malicious modifications. This can be achieved by decompiling the genuine application, merging it with the malicious code, and recompiling it.(Citation: CheckPoint Agent Smith)

Adversaries may also take action to conceal modifications to application executables and bypass user consent. These actions include altering modifications to appear as an update or exploiting vulnerabilities that allow activities of the malicious application to run inside a system application.(Citation: CheckPoint Agent Smith)";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1577;07 May 2020;27 May 2020;1.0;Persistence;This behavior is seamless to the user and is typically undetectable.;Android;;
T1532;Data Encrypted;Data is encrypted before being exfiltrated in order to hide the information that is being exfiltrated from detection or to make the exfiltration less conspicuous upon inspection by a defender. The encryption is performed by a utility, programming library, or custom algorithm on the data itself and is considered separate from any encryption performed by the command and control or file transfer protocol. Common file formats that can encrypt files are RAR and zip.;https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1532;10 October 2019;10 October 2019;1.0;Exfiltration;Many encryption mechanisms are built into standard application-accessible APIs, and are therefore undetectable to the end user.;Android, iOS;;
T1471;Data Encrypted for Impact;An adversary may encrypt files stored on the mobile device to prevent the user from accessing them, for example with the intent of only unlocking access to the files after a ransom is paid. Without escalated privileges, the adversary is generally limited to only encrypting files in external/shared storage locations. This technique has been demonstrated on Android. We are unaware of any demonstrated use on iOS.;https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1471;25 October 2017;01 October 2019;3.0;Impact;;Android;APP-28;
T1533;Data from Local System;"Sensitive data can be collected from local system sources, such as the file system or databases of information residing on the system.

Local system data includes information stored by the operating system. Access to local system data often requires escalated privileges (e.g. root access). Examples of local system data include authentication tokens, the device keyboard cache, Wi-Fi passwords, and photos.";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1533;10 October 2019;11 October 2019;1.0;Collection;Accessing data from the local system can be difficult to detect, and therefore enterprises may be better served focusing on detection at other stages of adversarial behavior.;Android, iOS;;
T1447;Delete Device Data;"Adversaries may wipe a device or delete individual files in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activity. An application must have administrator access to fully wipe the device, while individual files may not require special permissions to delete depending on their storage location. (Citation: Android DevicePolicyManager 2019)

Stored data could include a variety of file formats, such as Office files, databases, stored emails, and custom file formats. The impact file deletion will have depends on the type of data as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary, but can include deleting update files to evade detection or deleting attacker-specified files for impact.";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1447;25 October 2017;01 October 2020;2.1;Defense Evasion, Impact;Mobile security products can detect which applications can request device administrator permissions. Users can view applications with administrator access through the device settings, and may also notice if user data is inexplicably missing.;Android;;
T1475;Deliver Malicious App via Authorized App Store;"Malicious applications are a common attack vector used by adversaries to gain a presence on mobile devices. Mobile devices often are configured to allow application installation only from an authorized app store (e.g., Google Play Store or Apple App Store). An adversary may seek to place a malicious application in an authorized app store, enabling the application to be installed onto targeted devices.

App stores typically require developer registration and use vetting techniques to identify malicious applications. Adversaries may use these techniques against app store defenses:

* [Download New Code at Runtime](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1407)
* [Obfuscated Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1406)

Adversaries may also seek to evade vetting by placing code in a malicious application to detect whether it is running in an app analysis environment and, if so, avoid performing malicious actions while under analysis. (Citation: Petsas) (Citation: Oberheide-Bouncer) (Citation: Percoco-Bouncer) (Citation: Wang)

Adversaries may also use fake identities, payment cards, etc., to create developer accounts to publish malicious applications to app stores. (Citation: Oberheide-Bouncer)

Adversaries may also use control of a target's Google account to use the Google Play Store's remote installation capability to install apps onto the Android devices associated with the Google account. (Citation: Oberheide-RemoteInstall) (Citation: Konoth) (Only applications that are available for download through the Google Play Store can be remotely installed using this technique.)";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1475;17 October 2018;14 October 2019;1.1;Initial Access;"* An EMM/MDM or mobile threat defense solution can identify the presence of unwanted or known insecure or malicious apps on devices.
* Developers can scan (or have a third party scan on their behalf) the app stores for presence of unauthorized apps that were submitted using the developer's identity.";Android, iOS;ECO-4;
T1476;Deliver Malicious App via Other Means;"Malicious applications are a common attack vector used by adversaries to gain a presence on mobile devices. This technique describes installing a malicious application on targeted mobile devices without involving an authorized app store (e.g., Google Play Store or Apple App Store). Adversaries may wish to avoid placing malicious applications in an authorized app store due to increased potential risk of detection or other reasons. However, mobile devices often are configured to allow application installation only from an authorized app store which would prevent this technique from working.

Delivery methods for the malicious application include:

* [Spearphishing Attachment](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/001) - Including the mobile app package as an attachment to an email message.
* [Spearphishing Link](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566/002) - Including a link to the mobile app package within an email, text message (e.g. SMS, iMessage, Hangouts, WhatsApp, etc.), web site, QR code, or other means.
* Third-Party App Store - Installed from a third-party app store (as opposed to an authorized app store that the device implicitly trusts as part of its default behavior), which may not apply the same level of scrutiny to apps as applied by an authorized app store.(Citation: IBTimes-ThirdParty)(Citation: TrendMicro-RootingMalware)(Citation: TrendMicro-FlappyBird)

Some Android malware comes with functionality to install additional applications, either automatically or when the adversary instructs it to.(Citation: android-trojan-steals-paypal-2fa)";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1476;17 October 2018;09 February 2021;1.2;Initial Access;"* An EMM/MDM or mobile threat defense solution may be able to identify the presence of apps installed from sources other than an authorized app store. 
* An EMM/MDM or mobile threat defense solution may be able to identify Android devices configured to allow apps to be installed from ""Unknown Sources"".
* Enterprise email security solutions can identify the presence of Android or iOS application packages within email messages.";Android, iOS;AUT-9;
T1401;Device Administrator Permissions;"Adversaries may request device administrator permissions to perform malicious actions.

By abusing the device administration API, adversaries can perform several nefarious actions, such as resetting the deviceÕs password for [Device Lockout](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1446), factory resetting the device to [Delete Device Data](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1447) and any traces of the malware, disabling all of the deviceÕs cameras, or make it more difficult to uninstall the app.(Citation: Android DeviceAdminInfo)

Device administrators must be approved by the user at runtime, with a system popup showing which of the actions have been requested by the app. In conjunction with other techniques, such as [Input Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1516), an app can programmatically grant itself administrator permissions without any user input.";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1401;25 October 2017;24 November 2020;2.0;Privilege Escalation;Users can see when an app requests device administrator permissions. Users can also view which apps have device administrator permissions in the settings menu.;Android;APP-22;
T1446;Device Lockout;"An adversary may seek to lock the legitimate user out of the device, for example to inhibit user interaction or to obtain a ransom payment.

On Android versions prior to 7, apps can abuse Device Administrator access to reset the device lock passcode to prevent the user from unlocking the device. After Android 7, only device or profile owners (e.g. MDMs) can reset the deviceÕs passcode.(Citation: Android resetPassword)

On iOS devices, this technique does not work because mobile device management servers can only remove the screen lock passcode, they cannot set a new passcode. However, on jailbroken devices, malware has been discovered that can lock the user out of the device.(Citation: Xiao-KeyRaider)";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1446;25 October 2017;09 October 2019;2.0;Defense Evasion, Impact;On Android, users can review which applications have device administrator access in the device settings, and revoke permission where appropriate.;Android, iOS;APP-28;
T1408;Disguise Root/Jailbreak Indicators;"An adversary could use knowledge of the techniques used by security software to evade detection(Citation: Brodie)(Citation: Tan). For example, some mobile security products perform compromised device detection by searching for particular artifacts such as an installed ""su"" binary, but that check could be evaded by naming the binary something else. Similarly, polymorphic code techniques could be used to evade signature-based detection(Citation: Rastogi).";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1408;25 October 2017;03 February 2019;1.1;Defense Evasion;;Android, iOS;EMM-5;
T1520;Domain Generation Algorithms;"Adversaries may use [Domain Generation Algorithms](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1520) (DGAs) to procedurally generate domain names for command and control communication, and other uses such as malicious application distribution.(Citation: securelist rotexy 2018)

DGAs increase the difficulty for defenders to block, track, or take over the command and control channel, as there potentially could be thousands of domains that malware can check for instructions.";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1520;23 September 2019;23 September 2019;1.0;Command And Control;Detecting dynamically generated domains can be challenging due to the number of different DGA algorithms, constantly evolving malware families, and the increasing complexity of the algorithms. There is a myriad of approaches for detecting a pseudo-randomly generated domain name, including using frequency analysis, Markov chains, entropy, proportion of dictionary words, ratio of vowels to other characters, and more.(Citation: Data Driven Security DGA) CDN domains may trigger these detections due to the format of their domain names. In addition to detecting a DGA domain based on the name, another more general approach for detecting a suspicious domain is to check for recently registered names or for rarely visited domains.;Android, iOS;;
T1466;Downgrade to Insecure Protocols;An adversary could cause the mobile device to use less secure protocols, for example by jamming frequencies used by newer protocols such as LTE and only allowing older protocols such as GSM to communicate(Citation: NIST-SP800187). Use of less secure protocols may make communication easier to eavesdrop upon or manipulate.;https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1466;25 October 2017;03 February 2019;1.1;Network Effects;;Android, iOS;CEL-3;
T1407;Download New Code at Runtime;"An app could download and execute dynamic code (not included in the original application package) after installation to evade static analysis techniques (and potentially dynamic analysis techniques) used for application vetting or application store review.(Citation: Poeplau-ExecuteThis)

On Android, dynamic code could include native code, Dalvik code, or JavaScript code that uses the Android WebView's JavascriptInterface capability.(Citation: Bromium-AndroidRCE)

On iOS, techniques also exist for executing dynamic code downloaded after application installation.(Citation: FireEye-JSPatch)(Citation: Wang)";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1407;25 October 2017;09 October 2019;1.2;Defense Evasion;Downloading new code at runtime can be difficult to detect, and therefore enterprises may be better served focusing on detection at other stages of adversary behavior.;Android, iOS;APP-20;
T1456;Drive-by Compromise;"As described by [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189), a drive-by compromise is when an adversary gains access to a system through a user visiting a website over the normal course of browsing. With this technique, the user's web browser is targeted for exploitation. For example, a website may contain malicious media content intended to exploit vulnerabilities in media parsers as demonstrated by the Android Stagefright vulnerability  (Citation: Zimperium-Stagefright).

(This technique was formerly known as Malicious Web Content. It has been renamed to better align with ATT&CK for Enterprise.)";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1456;25 October 2017;17 October 2018;1.0;Initial Access;;Android, iOS;CEL-22;

T1523;Evade Analysis Environment;"Malicious applications may attempt to detect their operating environment prior to fully executing their payloads. These checks are often used to ensure the application is not running within an analysis environment such as a sandbox used for application vetting, security research, or reverse engineering. 
Adversaries may use many different checks such as physical sensors, location, and system properties to fingerprint emulators and sandbox environments.(Citation: Talos Gustuff Apr 2019)(Citation: ThreatFabric Cerberus)(Citation: Xiao-ZergHelper)(Citation: Cyberscoop Evade Analysis January 2019) Adversaries may access `android.os.SystemProperties` via Java reflection to obtain specific system information.(Citation: Github Anti-emulator) Standard values such as phone number, IMEI, IMSI, device IDs, and device drivers may be checked against default signatures of common sandboxes.(Citation: Sophos Anti-emulation)

### Baseband Vulnerability Exploitation

A message sent over a radio interface (typically cellular, but potentially Bluetooth, GPS, NFC, Wi-Fi(Citation: ProjectZero-BroadcomWiFi) or other) to the mobile device could exploit a vulnerability in code running on the device(Citation: Register-BaseStation)(Citation: Weinmann-Baseband).

### Malicious SMS Message

An SMS message could contain content designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the SMS parser on the receiving device(Citation: Forbes-iPhoneSMS).

T1420;File and Directory Discovery;"On Android, command line tools or the Java file APIs can be used to enumerate file system contents. However, Linux file permissions and SELinux policies generally strongly restrict what can be accessed by apps (without taking advantage of a privilege escalation exploit). The contents of the external storage directory are generally visible, which could present concern if sensitive data is inappropriately stored there.

T1541;Foreground Persistence;"Adversaries may abuse Android's `startForeground()` API method to maintain continuous sensor access. Beginning in Android 9, idle applications running in the background no longer have access to device sensors, such as the camera, microphone, and gyroscope.(Citation: Android-SensorsOverview) Applications can retain sensor access by running in the foreground, using AndroidÕs `startForeground()` API method. This informs the system that the user is actively interacting with the application, and it should not be killed. The only requirement to start a foreground service is showing a persistent notification to the user.(Citation: Android-ForegroundServices)

Malicious applications may abuse the `startForeground()` API method to continue running in the foreground, while presenting a notification to the user pretending to be a genuine application. This would allow unhindered access to the deviceÕs sensors, assuming permission has been previously granted.(Citation: BlackHat Sutter Android Foreground 2019)

Malicious applications may also abuse the `startForeground()` API to inform the Android system that the user is actively interacting with the application, thus preventing it from being killed by the low memory killer.(Citation: TrendMicro-Yellow Camera)";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1541;19 November 2019;26 December 2019;1.0;Collection, Persistence;Users can see persistent notifications in their notification drawer and can subsequently uninstall applications that do not belong.;Android;APP-19;Lorin Wu, Trend Micro
T1472;Generate Fraudulent Advertising Revenue;An adversary could seek to generate fraudulent advertising revenue from mobile devices, for example by triggering automatic clicks of advertising links without user involvement.;https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1472;25 October 2017;03 July 2019;1.0;Impact;;Android, iOS;;
T1581;Geofencing;"Adversaries may use a deviceÕs geographical location to limit certain malicious behaviors. For example, malware operators may limit the distribution of a second stage payload to certain geographic regions.(Citation: Lookout eSurv)

[Geofencing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1581) is accomplished by persuading the user to grant the application permission to access location services. The application can then collect, process, and exfiltrate the deviceÕs location to perform location-based actions, such as ceasing malicious behavior or showing region-specific advertisements.

One method to accomplish [Geofencing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1581) on Android is to use the built-in Geofencing API to automatically trigger certain behaviors when the device enters or exits a specified radius around a geographical location. Similar to other [Geofencing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1581) methods, this requires that the user has granted the `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` and `ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION` permissions. The latter is only required if the application targets Android 10 (API level 29) or higher. However, Android 11 introduced additional permission controls that may restrict background location collection based on user permission choices at runtime. These additional controls include ÒAllow only while using the appÓ, which will effectively prohibit background location collection.(Citation: Android Geofencing API)

Similarly, on iOS, developers can use built-in APIs to setup and execute geofencing. Depending on the use case, the app will either need to call `requestWhenInUseAuthorization()` or `requestAlwaysAuthorization()`, depending on when access to the location services is required. Similar to Android, users also have the option to limit when the application can access the deviceÕs location, including one-time use and only when the application is running in the foreground.(Citation: Apple Location Services)

[Geofencing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1581) can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within. For example, location data could be used to limit malware spread and/or capabilities, which could also potentially evade application analysis environments (ex: malware analysis outside of the target geographic area). Other malicious usages could include showing language-specific [Input Prompt](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1411)s and/or advertisements.";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1581;11 September 2020;01 October 2020;1.0;Defense Evasion;Users can review which applications have location permissions in the operating systemÕs settings menu. On Android 10 and later, the system shows a notification to the user when an app has been accessing device location in the background.;Android, iOS;;
T1417;Input Capture;"Adversaries may capture user input to obtain credentials or other information from the user through various methods.

Malware may masquerade as a legitimate third-party keyboard to record user keystrokes.(Citation: Zeltser-Keyboard) On both Android and iOS, users must explicitly authorize the use of third-party keyboard apps. Users should be advised to use extreme caution before granting this authorization when it is requested.

On Android, malware may abuse accessibility features to record keystrokes by registering an `AccessibilityService` class, overriding the `onAccessibilityEvent` method, and listening for the `AccessibilityEvent.TYPE_VIEW_TEXT_CHANGED` event type. The event object passed into the function will contain the data that the user typed.

Additional methods of keylogging may be possible if root access is available.";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1417;25 October 2017;24 June 2020;2.1;Collection, Credential Access;On Android, users can view and manage which applications have third-party keyboard access through the device settings in System -> Languages & input -> Virtual keyboard. On iOS, users can view and manage which applications have third-party keyboard access through the device settings in General -> Keyboard. On Android, users can view and manage which applications can use accessibility services through the device settings in Accessibility. The exact device settings menu locations may vary between operating system versions.;Android, iOS;;
T1516;Input Injection;"A malicious application can inject input to the user interface to mimic user interaction through the abuse of Android's accessibility APIs.

[Input Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1516) can be achieved using any of the following methods:

* Mimicking user clicks on the screen, for example to steal money from a user's PayPal account.(Citation: android-trojan-steals-paypal-2fa)
* Injecting global actions, such as `GLOBAL_ACTION_BACK` (programatically mimicking a physical back button press), to trigger actions on behalf of the user.(Citation: Talos Gustuff Apr 2019)
* Inserting input into text fields on behalf of the user. This method is used legitimately to auto-fill text fields by applications such as password managers.(Citation: bitwarden autofill logins)";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1516;15 September 2019;24 June 2020;1.1;Defense Evasion, Impact;Users can view applications that have registered accessibility services in the accessibility menu within the device settings.;Android;;Luk‡_ _tefanko, ESET
T1411;Input Prompt;"The operating system and installed applications often have legitimate needs to prompt the user for sensitive information such as account credentials, bank account information, or Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Adversaries may mimic this functionality to prompt users for sensitive information.

Compared to traditional PCs, the constrained display size of mobile devices may impair the ability to provide users with contextual information, making users more susceptible to this techniqueÕs use.(Citation: Felt-PhishingOnMobileDevices)

Specific approaches to this technique include:

### Impersonate the identity of a legitimate application

A malicious application could impersonate the identity of a legitimate application (e.g. use the same application name and/or icon) and get installed on the device. The malicious app could then prompt the user for sensitive information.(Citation: eset-finance)

### Display a prompt on top of a running legitimate application

A malicious application could display a prompt on top of a running legitimate application to trick users into entering sensitive information into the malicious application rather than the legitimate application. Typically, the malicious application would need to know when the targeted application (and individual activity within the targeted application) is running in the foreground, so that the malicious application knows when to display its prompt. Android 5.0 and 5.1.1, respectively, increased the difficulty of determining the current foreground application through modifications to the `ActivityManager` API.(Citation: Android-getRunningTasks)(Citation: StackOverflow-getRunningAppProcesses). A malicious application can still abuse AndroidÕs accessibility features to determine which application is currently in the foreground.(Citation: ThreatFabric Cerberus) Approaches to display a prompt include:

* A malicious application could start a new activity on top of a running legitimate application.(Citation: Felt-PhishingOnMobileDevices)(Citation: Hassell-ExploitingAndroid) Android 10 places new restrictions on the ability for an application to start a new activity on top of another application, which may make it more difficult for adversaries to utilize this technique.(Citation: Android Background)
* A malicious application could create an application overlay window on top of a running legitimate application. Applications must hold the `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` permission to create overlay windows. This permission is handled differently than typical Android permissions, and at least under certain conditions is automatically granted to applications installed from the Google Play Store.(Citation: Cloak and Dagger)(Citation: NowSecure Android Overlay)(Citation: Skycure-Accessibility) The `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` permission and its associated ability to create application overlay windows are expected to be deprecated in a future release of Android in favor of a new API.(Citation: XDA Bubbles)

### Fake device notifications

A malicious application could send fake device notifications to the user. Clicking on the device notification could trigger the malicious application to display an input prompt.(Citation: Group IB Gustuff Mar 2019)";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1411;25 October 2017;24 June 2020;2.1;Credential Access;The user can view and manage which applications hold the SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission to create overlay windows on top of other apps through the device settings in Apps & notifications -> Special app access -> Display over other apps (the exact menu location may vary between Android versions).;Android, iOS;APP-31;
T1478;Install Insecure or Malicious Configuration;"An adversary could attempt to install insecure or malicious configuration settings on the mobile device, through means such as phishing emails or text messages either directly containing the configuration settings as an attachment, or containing a web link to the configuration settings. The device user may be tricked into installing the configuration settings through social engineering techniques (Citation: Symantec-iOSProfile).

For example, an unwanted Certification Authority (CA) certificate could be placed in the device's trusted certificate store, increasing the device's susceptibility to man-in-the-middle network attacks seeking to eavesdrop on or manipulate the device's network communication ([Eavesdrop on Insecure Network Communication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1439) and [Manipulate Device Communication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1463)).

On iOS, malicious Configuration Profiles could contain unwanted Certification Authority (CA) certificates or other insecure settings such as unwanted proxy server or VPN settings to route the device's network traffic through an adversary's system. The device could also potentially be enrolled into a malicious Mobile Device Management (MDM) system (Citation: Talos-MDM).";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1478;17 October 2018;17 October 2018;1.0;Defense Evasion, Initial Access;"On Android, the user can view trusted CA certificates through the device settings and look for unexpected certificates. A mobile security product could similarly examine the trusted CA certificate store for anomalies.

On iOS, the user can view installed Configuration Profiles through the device settings and look for unexpected profiles. A Mobile Device Management (MDM) system could use the iOS MDM APIs to examine the list of installed Configuration Profiles for anomalies.";Android, iOS;STA-7;
T1464;Jamming or Denial of Service;An attacker could jam radio signals (e.g. Wi-Fi, cellular, GPS) to prevent the mobile device from communicating. (Citation: NIST-SP800187)(Citation: CNET-Celljammer)(Citation: NYTimes-Celljam)(Citation: Digitaltrends-Celljam)(Citation: Arstechnica-Celljam);https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1464;25 October 2017;03 February 2019;1.1;Network Effects;;Android, iOS;CEL-7;
T1579;Keychain;"Adversaries may collect the keychain storage data from an iOS device to acquire credentials. Keychains are the built-in way for iOS to keep track of users' passwords and credentials for many services and features such as Wi-Fi passwords, websites, secure notes, certificates, private keys, and VPN credentials.

On the device, the keychain database is stored outside of application sandboxes to prevent unauthorized access to the raw data. Standard iOS APIs allow applications access to their own keychain contained within the database. By utilizing a privilege escalation exploit or existing root access, an adversary can access the entire encrypted database.(Citation: Apple Keychain Services)(Citation: Elcomsoft Decrypt Keychain)";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1579;24 June 2020;24 June 2020;1.0;Credential Access;Mobile security products can potentially detect jailbroken devices and perform further actions as necessary.;iOS;AUT-11;
T1430;Location Tracking;An adversary could use a malicious or exploited application to surreptitiously track the device's physical location through use of standard operating system APIs.;https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1430;25 October 2017;15 October 2019;1.0;Collection, Discovery;On both Android (6.0 and up) and iOS, the user can view which applications have permission to access device location through the device settings screen, and the user can choose to revoke the permissions.;Android, iOS;APP-24;
T1461;Lockscreen Bypass;"An adversary with physical access to a mobile device may seek to bypass the device's lockscreen.

### Biometric Spoofing
If biometric authentication is used, an adversary could attempt to spoof a mobile device's biometric authentication mechanism(Citation: SRLabs-Fingerprint)(Citation: SecureIDNews-Spoof)(Citation: TheSun-FaceID).

iOS partly mitigates this attack by requiring the device passcode rather than a fingerprint to unlock the device after every device restart and after 48 hours since the device was last unlocked (Citation: Apple-TouchID). Android has similar mitigations.

### Device Unlock Code Guessing or Brute Force
An adversary could attempt to brute-force or otherwise guess the lockscreen passcode (typically a PIN or password), including physically observing (""shoulder surfing"") the device owner's use of the lockscreen passcode. 

### Exploit Other Device Lockscreen Vulnerabilities
Techniques have periodically been demonstrated that exploit vulnerabilities on Android (Citation: Wired-AndroidBypass), iOS (Citation: Kaspersky-iOSBypass), or other mobile devices to bypass the device lockscreen. The vulnerabilities are generally patched by the device/operating system vendor once they become aware of their existence.";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1461;25 October 2017;03 February 2019;1.1;Initial Access;;Android, iOS;;
T1452;Manipulate App Store Rankings or Ratings;An adversary could use access to a compromised device's credentials to attempt to manipulate app store rankings or ratings by triggering application downloads or posting fake reviews of applications. This technique likely requires privileged access (a rooted or jailbroken device).;https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1452;25 October 2017;03 July 2019;1.0;Impact;;Android, iOS;;
T1463;Manipulate Device Communication;If network traffic between the mobile device and a remote server is not securely protected, then an attacker positioned on the network may be able to manipulate network communication without being detected. For example, FireEye researchers found in 2014 that 68% of the top 1,000 free applications in the Google Play Store had at least one Transport Layer Security (TLS) implementation vulnerability potentially opening the applications' network traffic to man-in-the-middle attacks (Citation: FireEye-SSL).;https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1463;25 October 2017;17 October 2018;1.0;Network Effects;;Android, iOS;APP-1;
T1444;Masquerade as Legitimate Application;"An adversary could distribute developed malware by masquerading the malware as a legitimate application. This can be done in two different ways: by embedding the malware in a legitimate application, or by pretending to be a legitimate application.

Embedding the malware in a legitimate application is done by downloading the application, disassembling it, adding the malicious code, and then re-assembling it.(Citation: Zhou) The app would appear to be the original app, but would contain additional malicious functionality. The adversary could then publish the malicious application to app stores or use another delivery method.

Pretending to be a legitimate application relies heavily on lack of scrutinization by the user. Typically, a malicious app pretending to be a legitimate one will have many similar details as the legitimate one, such as name, icon, and description.(Citation: Palo Alto HenBox)

Malicious applications may also masquerade as legitimate applications when requesting access to the accessibility service in order to appear as legitimate to the user, increasing the likelihood that the access will be granted.";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1444;25 October 2017;08 April 2020;2.1;Defense Evasion, Initial Access;Users can detect malicious applications by watching for nuances that could indicate the application is not the intended one when it is being installed.;Android, iOS;APP-31;Alex Hinchliffe, Palo Alto Networks
T1403;Modify Cached Executable Code;ART (the Android Runtime) compiles optimized code on the device itself to improve performance. An adversary may be able to use escalated privileges to modify the cached code in order to hide malicious behavior. Since the code is compiled on the device, it may not receive the same level of integrity checks that are provided to code running in the system partition.(Citation: Sabanal-ART);https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1403;25 October 2017;09 October 2019;1.1;Persistence;Modifications to cached executable code can be difficult to detect, and therefore enterprises may be better served focusing on detection at other stages of adversary behavior.;Android;;
T1398;Modify OS Kernel or Boot Partition;"If an adversary can escalate privileges, he or she may be able to use those privileges to place malicious code in the device kernel or other boot partition components, where the code may evade detection, may persist after device resets, and may not be removable by the device user. In some cases (e.g., the Samsung Knox warranty bit as described under Detection), the attack may be detected but could result in the device being placed in a state that no longer allows certain functionality.

Many Android devices provide the ability to unlock the bootloader for development purposes, but doing so introduces the potential ability for others to maliciously update the kernel or other boot partition code.

If the bootloader is not unlocked, it may still be possible to exploit device vulnerabilities to update the code.";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1398;25 October 2017;17 October 2018;1.0;Defense Evasion, Persistence;"The Android SafetyNet API's remote attestation capability could potentially be used to identify and respond to compromised devices. Samsung KNOX also provides a remote attestation capability on supported Samsung Android devices.

Samsung KNOX devices include a non-reversible Knox warranty bit fuse that is triggered ""if a non-Knox kernel has been loaded on the device"" (Citation: Samsung-KnoxWarrantyBit). If triggered, enterprise Knox container services will no longer be available on the device.

As described in the iOS Security Guide (Citation: Apple-iOSSecurityGuide), iOS devices will fail to boot or fail to allow device activation if unauthorized modifications are detected.

Many enterprise applications perform their own checks to detect and respond to compromised devices. These checks are not foolproof but can detect common signs of compromise.";Android, iOS;APP-26;
T1400;Modify System Partition;"If an adversary can escalate privileges, he or she may be able to use those privileges to place malicious code in the device system partition, where it may persist after device resets and may not be easily removed by the device user.

Many Android devices provide the ability to unlock the bootloader for development purposes. An unlocked bootloader may provide the ability for an adversary to modify the system partition. Even if the bootloader is locked, it may be possible for an adversary to escalate privileges and then modify the system partition.";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1400;25 October 2017;04 September 2019;1.2;Defense Evasion, Impact, Persistence;"Android devices with the Verified Boot capability (Citation: Android-VerifiedBoot) perform cryptographic checks of the integrity of the system partition.

iOS devices will fail to boot or fail to allow device activation if unauthorized modifications are detected.(Citation: Apple-iOSSecurityGuide)";Android, iOS;APP-27;
T1399;Modify Trusted Execution Environment;If an adversary can escalate privileges, he or she may be able to use those privileges to place malicious code in the device's Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) or other similar isolated execution environment where the code can evade detection, may persist after device resets, and may not be removable by the device user. Running code within the TEE may provide an adversary with the ability to monitor or tamper with overall device behavior.(Citation: Roth-Rootkits);https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1399;25 October 2017;03 February 2019;1.1;Defense Evasion, Persistence;"Devices may perform cryptographic integrity checks of code running within the TEE at boot time.

iOS devices will fail to boot if the software running within the Secure Enclave does not pass signature verification.(Citation: Apple-iOSSecurityGuide)";Android;APP-27;
T1575;Native Code;"Adversaries may use AndroidÕs Native Development Kit (NDK) to write native functions that can achieve execution of binaries or functions. Like system calls on a traditional desktop operating system, native code achieves execution on a lower level than normal Android SDK calls.

The NDK allows developers to write native code in C or C++ that is compiled directly to machine code, avoiding all intermediate languages and steps in compilation that higher level languages, like Java, typically have. The Java Native Interface (JNI) is the component that allows Java functions in the Android app to call functions in a native library.(Citation: Google NDK Getting Started)

Adversaries may also choose to use native functions to execute malicious code since native actions are typically much more difficult to analyze than standard, non-native behaviors.(Citation: MITRE App Vetting Effectiveness)";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1575;28 April 2020;28 April 2020;1.0;Defense Evasion, Execution;This is abuse of standard OS-level APIs and are therefore typically undetectable to the end user.;Android;;

T1423;Network Service Scanning;Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of services running on remote hosts, including those that may be vulnerable to remote software exploitation. Methods to acquire this information include port scans and vulnerability scans from the mobile device. This technique may take advantage of the mobile device's access to an internal enterprise network either through local connectivity or through a Virtual Private Network (VPN).;https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1423;25 October 2017;17 October 2018;1.0;Discovery;;Android, iOS;;
T1410;Network Traffic Capture or Redirection;"An adversary may capture network traffic to and from the device to obtain credentials or other sensitive data, or redirect network traffic to flow through an adversary-controlled gateway to do the same.

A malicious app could register itself as a VPN client on Android or iOS to gain access to network packets. However, on both platforms, the user must grant consent to the app to act as a VPN client, and on iOS the app requires a special entitlement that must be granted by Apple.

Alternatively, if a malicious app is able to escalate operating system privileges, it may be able to use those privileges to gain access to network traffic.

An adversary could redirect network traffic to an adversary-controlled gateway by establishing a VPN connection or by manipulating the device's proxy settings. For example, Skycure (Citation: Skycure-Profiles) describes the ability to redirect network traffic by installing a malicious iOS Configuration Profile.

If applications encrypt their network traffic, sensitive data may not be accessible to an adversary, depending on the point of capture.";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1410;25 October 2017;17 October 2018;1.0;Collection, Credential Access;On both Android and iOS the user must grant consent to an app to act as a VPN.

T1470;Obtain Device Cloud Backups;An adversary who is able to obtain unauthorized access to or misuse authorized access to cloud backup services (e.g. Google's Android backup service or Apple's iCloud) could use that access to obtain sensitive data stored in device backups. For example, the Elcomsoft Phone Breaker product advertises the ability to retrieve iOS backup data from Apple's iCloud (Citation: Elcomsoft-EPPB).

T1424;Process Discovery;On Android versions prior to 5, applications can observe information about other processes that are running through methods in the ActivityManager class. On Android versions prior to 7, applications can obtain this information by executing the <code>ps</code> command, or by examining the <code>/proc</code> directory. Starting in Android version 7, use of the Linux kernel's <code>hidepid</code> feature prevents applications (without escalated privileges) from accessing this information (Citation: Android-SELinuxChanges).;https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1424;25 October 2017;17 October 2018;1.0;Discovery;;Android;;
T1604;Proxy Through Victim;"Adversaries may use a compromised device as a proxy server to the Internet. By utilizing a proxy, adversaries hide the true IP address of their C2 server and associated infrastructure from the destination of the network traffic. This masquerades an adversaryÕs traffic as legitimate traffic originating from the compromised device, which can evade IP-based restrictions and alerts on certain services, such as bank accounts and social media websites.(Citation: Threat Fabric Exobot)

The most common type of proxy is a SOCKS proxy. It can typically be implemented using standard OS-level APIs and 3rd party libraries with no indication to the user. On Android, adversaries can use the `Proxy` API to programmatically establish a SOCKS proxy connection, or lower-level APIs to interact directly with raw sockets.";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1604;30 November 2020;04 December 2020;1.0;Defense Evasion;Enterprises may be able to detect anomalous traffic originating from mobile devices, which could indicate compromise.;Android;;
T1544;Remote File Copy;Files may be copied from one system to another to stage adversary tools or other files over the course of an operation. Files may be copied from an external adversary-controlled system through the Command and Control channel to bring tools into the victim network or onto the victimÕs device.;https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1544;21 January 2020;21 January 2020;1.0;Command And Control;Downloading remote files is common application behavior and is therefore typically undetectable to the end user.;Android, iOS;;
T1468;Remotely Track Device Without Authorization;An adversary who is able to obtain unauthorized access to or misuse authorized access to cloud services (e.g. Google's Android Device Manager or Apple iCloud's Find my iPhone) or to an enterprise mobility management (EMM) / mobile device management (MDM) server console could use that access to track mobile devices.(Citation: Krebs-Location);https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1468;25 October 2017;03 February 2019;1.1;Remote Service Effects;Google sends a notification to the device when Android Device Manager is used to locate it. Additionally, Google provides the ability for users to view their general account activity. Apple iCloud also provides notifications to users of account activity.;Android, iOS;ECO-5;
T1469;Remotely Wipe Data Without Authorization;An adversary who is able to obtain unauthorized access to or misuse authorized access to cloud services (e.g. Google's Android Device Manager or Apple iCloud's Find my iPhone) or to an EMM console could use that access to wipe enrolled devices (Citation: Honan-Hacking).;https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1469;25 October 2017;17 October 2018;1.0;Remote Service Effects;Google provides the ability for users to view their general account activity. Apple iCloud also provides notifications to users of account activity.;Android, iOS;ECO-5;
T1467;Rogue Cellular Base Station;An adversary could set up a rogue cellular base station and then use it to eavesdrop on or manipulate cellular device communication. A compromised cellular femtocell could be used to carry out this technique(Citation: Computerworld-Femtocell).;https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1467;25 October 2017;03 February 2019;1.1;Network Effects;;Android, iOS;CEL-7;
T1465;Rogue Wi-Fi Access Points;An adversary could set up unauthorized Wi-Fi access points or compromise existing access points and, if the device connects to them, carry out network-based attacks such as eavesdropping on or modifying network communication(Citation: NIST-SP800153)(Citation: Kaspersky-DarkHotel).;https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1465;25 October 2017;03 February 2019;1.1;Network Effects;;Android, iOS;LPN-0;
T1451;SIM Card Swap;"An adversary could convince the mobile network operator (e.g. through social networking, forged identification, or insider attacks performed by trusted employees) to issue a new SIM card and associate it with an existing phone number and account (Citation: NYGov-Simswap) (Citation: Motherboard-Simswap2). The adversary could then obtain SMS messages or hijack phone calls intended for someone else (Citation: Betanews-Simswap). 

One use case is intercepting authentication messages or phone calls to obtain illicit access to online banking or other online accounts, as many online services allow account password resets by sending an authentication code over SMS to a phone number associated with the account (Citation: Guardian-Simswap) (Citation: Motherboard-Simswap1)(Citation: Krebs-SimSwap)(Citation: TechCrunch-SimSwap).";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1451;25 October 2017;03 February 2019;1.1;Network Effects;;Android, iOS;STA-22;
T1582;SMS Control;"Adversaries may delete, alter, or send SMS messages without user authorization. This could be used to hide C2 SMS messages, spread malware, or various external effects.

This can be accomplished by requesting the `RECEIVE_SMS` or `SEND_SMS` permissions depending on what the malware is attempting to do. If the app is set as the default SMS handler on the device, the `SMS_DELIVER` broadcast intent can be registered, which allows the app to write to the SMS content provider. The content provider directly modifies the messaging database on the device, which could allow malicious applications with this ability to insert, modify, or delete arbitrary messages on the device.(Citation: SMS KitKat)(Citation: Android SmsProvider)";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1582;11 September 2020;22 October 2020;1.0;Impact;Users can view the default SMS handler in system settings.;Android;APP-16;
T1603;Scheduled Task/Job;"Adversaries may abuse task scheduling functionality to facilitate initial or recurring execution of malicious code. On Android and iOS, APIs and libraries exist to facilitate scheduling tasks to execute at a specified date, time, or interval.

On Android, the `WorkManager` API allows asynchronous tasks to be scheduled with the system. `WorkManager` was introduced to unify task scheduling on Android, using `JobScheduler`, `GcmNetworkManager`, and `AlarmManager` internally. `WorkManager` offers a lot of flexibility for scheduling, including periodically, one time, or constraint-based (e.g. only when the device is charging).(Citation: Android WorkManager)

On iOS, the `NSBackgroundActivityScheduler` API allows asynchronous tasks to be scheduled with the system. The tasks can be scheduled to be repeating or non-repeating, however, the system chooses when the tasks will be executed. The app can choose the interval for repeating tasks, or the delay between scheduling and execution for one-time tasks.(Citation: Apple NSBackgroundActivityScheduler)";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1603;04 November 2020;04 November 2020;1.0;Execution, Persistence;Scheduling tasks/jobs can be difficult to detect, and therefore enterprises may be better served focusing on detection at other stages of adversarial behavior.;Android, iOS;;Lorin Wu, Trend Micro
T1513;Screen Capture;Adversaries may use screen captures to collect information about applications running in the foreground, capture user data, credentials, or other sensitive information. Applications running in the background can capture screenshots or videos of another application running in the foreground by using the Android `MediaProjectionManager` (generally requires the device user to grant consent).(Citation: Fortinet screencap July 2019)(Citation: Android ScreenCap1 2019) Background applications can also use Android accessibility services to capture screen contents being displayed by a foreground application.(Citation: Lookout-Monokle) An adversary with root access or Android Debug Bridge (adb) access could call the Android `screencap` or `screenrecord` commands.(Citation: Android ScreenCap2 2019)(Citation: Trend Micro ScreenCap July 2015);https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1513;08 August 2019;24 June 2020;1.1;Collection;The user can view a list of apps with accessibility service privileges in the device settings.;Android;APP-40;
T1437;Standard Application Layer Protocol;"Adversaries may communicate using a common, standardized application layer protocol such as HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, or DNS to avoid detection by blending in with existing traffic.

In the mobile environment, the Google Cloud Messaging (GCM; two-way) and Apple Push Notification Service (APNS; one-way server-to-device) are commonly used protocols on Android and iOS respectively that would blend in with routine device traffic and are difficult for enterprises to inspect. Google reportedly responds to reports of abuse by blocking access to GCM.(Citation: Kaspersky-MobileMalware)";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1437;25 October 2017;03 February 2019;1.1;Command And Control, Exfiltration;;Android, iOS;APP-29;
T1521;Standard Cryptographic Protocol;Adversaries may explicitly employ a known encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol. Despite the use of a secure algorithm, these implementations may be vulnerable to reverse engineering if necessary secret keys are encoded and/or generated within malware samples/configuration files.;https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1521;01 October 2019;01 October 2019;1.0;Command And Control;Since data encryption is a common practice in many legitimate applications and uses standard programming language-specific APIs, encrypting data for command and control communication is undetectable to the user.;Android, iOS;;
T1474;Supply Chain Compromise;"As further described in [Supply Chain Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1195), supply chain compromise is the manipulation of products or product delivery mechanisms prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise. Somewhat related, adversaries could also identify and exploit inadvertently present vulnerabilities. In many cases, it may be difficult to be certain whether exploitable functionality is due to malicious intent or simply inadvertent mistake.

Third-party libraries incorporated into mobile apps could contain malicious behavior, privacy-invasive behavior, or exploitable vulnerabilities. An adversary could deliberately insert malicious behavior or could exploit inadvertent vulnerabilities. For example, security issues have previously been identified in third-party advertising libraries incorporated into apps.(Citation: NowSecure-RemoteCode)(Citation: Grace-Advertisement).";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1474;17 October 2018;10 March 2021;1.1;Initial Access;"* Insecure third-party libraries could be detected by application vetting techniques. For example, Google's [App Security Improvement Program](https://developer.android.com/google/play/asi) detects the use of third-party libraries with known vulnerabilities within Android apps submitted to the Google Play Store.
* Malicious software development tools could be detected by enterprises deploying integrity checking software to the computers that they use to develop code to detect presence of unauthorized, modified software development tools.";Android, iOS;APP-6;
T1508;Suppress Application Icon;"A malicious application could suppress its icon from being displayed to the user in the application launcher to hide the fact that it is installed, and to make it more difficult for the user to uninstall the application. Hiding the application's icon programmatically does not require any special permissions.

This behavior has been seen in the BankBot/Spy Banker family of malware.(Citation: android-trojan-steals-paypal-2fa)(Citation: sunny-stolen-credentials)(Citation: bankbot-spybanker)";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1508;11 July 2019;14 November 2019;1.1;Defense Evasion;The user can examine the list of all installed applications, including those with a suppressed icon, in the device settings.;Android;;Emily Ratliff, IBM
T1426;System Information Discovery;"An adversary may attempt to get detailed information about the operating system and hardware, including version, patches, and architecture.

On Android, much of this information is programmatically accessible to applications through the android.os.Build class.(Citation: Android-Build)

On iOS, techniques exist for applications to programmatically access this information.(Citation: StackOverflow-iOSVersion)";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1426;25 October 2017;20 November 2019;1.1;Discovery;;Android, iOS;;
T1422;System Network Configuration Discovery;"On Android, details of onboard network interfaces are accessible to apps through the `java.net.NetworkInterface` class.(Citation: NetworkInterface) The Android `TelephonyManager` class can be used to gather related information such as the IMSI, IMEI, and phone number.(Citation: TelephonyManager)

On iOS, gathering network configuration information is not possible without root access.";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1422;25 October 2017;02 June 2020;2.1;Discovery;;Android, iOS;;
T1421;System Network Connections Discovery;On Android, applications can use standard APIs to gather a list of network connections to and from the device. For example, the Network Connections app available in the Google Play Store (Citation: ConnMonitor) advertises this functionality.;https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1421;25 October 2017;01 February 2019;2.0;Discovery;;Android;;
T1416;URI Hijacking;"Adversaries may register Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to intercept sensitive data.

Applications regularly register URIs with the operating system to act as a response handler for various actions, such as logging into an app using an external account via single sign-on. This allows redirections to that specific URI to be intercepted by the application. If a malicious application were to register for a URI that was already in use by a genuine application, the malicious application may be able to intercept data intended for the genuine application or perform a phishing attack against the genuine application. Intercepted data may include OAuth authorization codes or tokens that could be used by the malicious application to gain access to resources.(Citation: Trend Micro iOS URL Hijacking)(Citation: IETF-PKCE)";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1416;25 October 2017;01 October 2020;2.0;Credential Access;On Android, users may be presented with a popup to select the appropriate application to open the URI in. If the user sees an application they do not recognize, they can remove it.;Android, iOS;;"Leo Zhang, Trend Micro; Steven Du, Trend Micro"
T1509;Uncommonly Used Port;Adversaries may use non-standard ports to exfiltrate information.;https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1509;01 August 2019;11 September 2019;1.0;Command And Control;Detection would most likely be at the enterprise level, through packet and/or netflow inspection. Many properly configured firewalls may also naturally block command and control traffic over non-standard ports.;Android, iOS;;
T1576;Uninstall Malicious Application;"Adversaries may include functionality in malware that uninstalls the malicious application from the device. This can be achieved by:

* Abusing device owner permissions to perform silent uninstallation using device owner API calls.
* Abusing root permissions to delete files from the filesystem.
* Abusing the accessibility service. This requires an intent be sent to the system to request uninstallation, and then abusing the accessibility service to click the proper places on the screen to confirm uninstallation.";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1576;04 May 2020;26 May 2020;1.0;Defense Evasion;;Android;APP-43;
T1481;Web Service;"Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service as a means for relaying commands to a compromised system.

These commands may also include pointers to command and control (C2) infrastructure. Adversaries may post content, known as a dead drop resolver, on Web services with embedded (and often obfuscated/encoded) domains or IP addresses. Once infected, victims will reach out to and be redirected by these resolvers.

Popular websites and social media acting as a mechanism for C2 may give a significant amount of cover due to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them prior to a compromise. Using common services, such as those offered by Google or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. Web service providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of protection.

Use of Web services may also protect back-end C2 infrastructure from discovery through malware binary analysis while also enabling operational resiliency (since this infrastructure may be dynamically changed).";https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1481;01 February 2019;01 February 2019;1.0;Command And Control;;Android, iOS;;
